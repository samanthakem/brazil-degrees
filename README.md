This project was created as part of the [SDJS talk](https://www.meetup.com/sandiegojs/events/dvzwsqyzgbdb/) held at Intuit on May 7th 2019.

Here, you will find two directories:
- `socket-io-client`
- `socket-io-server`

The react directory `(socket-io-client)` was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

To run this project, first install all the dependencies by going inside both directories and run `npm i`, then go to `socket-io-server` directory and run `node app.js` and go to `socket-io-client` and run `npm start`.
